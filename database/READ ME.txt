To make this work, Cassandra must be running locally.


1. Install Python and Java on your machine.

2. Get Cassandra 3.0.0 from here:
http://archive.apache.org/dist/cassandra/3.0.0/apache-cassandra-3.0.0-bin.tar.gz

3. Unpack it somewhere

4. In the extracted Cassandra folder there is a bin folder. Make sure that one is in your PATH variable!!!!!

5. Run Cassandra by executing the "cassandra" command. This only works if you've done step 4 correctly.

5. While Cassandra is running, import setup.cql into it by running
    cqlsh --file=link-data-stream-analysis\database\setup.cql

6. Done!
