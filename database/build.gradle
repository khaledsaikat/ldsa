    We really can't use Kundera because it won't work with the 3.0.0 series of Datastax' Cassandra drivers.
    It does however work fine with the older ones (2.0) - but we can't use these because they can't connect with 3.0.0
    Cassandra nodes. Therefore we fell back to QueryBuilder in Datastax' driver - even though this isn't JPA =(
